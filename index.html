            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Adrian was found by Gaius Augustine, presumably dying, whereby the latter saved his life by Turning him into a vampire. He woke up in a cabin, bloody and bewildered by his surroundings and circumstances. After a brief update from Gaius, he was forced to kill a nearby man to quench his bloodthirst; this, according to Adrian, is the only time he had murdered a human. However, this is proven to be false in Chapter 9, when a book hints at Adrian and Gaius going on a murderous rampage shortly after turning. It's further confirmed to be untrue when in Chapter 10, another portrait fragment shows him killing Banner Westbrook.

In Chapter 14, Adrian revealed to Your Character and Kamilah details of his mortal life. He bought 20 acres of land in 1775 and built a house for himself, his wife, Eleanor, and his 18-month old son, Charles in Upstate New York. When he was home recovering from an injury during the Revolutionary War, Eleanor went out to get water and found a hurt human begging for help. She offered him shelter and comfort back at the house. Later that night, Adrian heard a commotion in the main room but couldn't get to there in time due to his injured leg. He came out to find the man had killed Eleanor and had fatally wounded Charles. Adrian fought him, was stabbed in the chest, but was able to kill the man by smashing his skull against the fireplace. He was too late to say goodbye to Eleanor but held Charles for a few moments before he died. He was found and Turned by Gaius shortly after.  He has a locket with a picture of Eleanor and Charles and kept it with him ever since.

A few centuries later, Adrian would be the leader of one of six vampire clans in New York and the CEO of a massive company.</p>
